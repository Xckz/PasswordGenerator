## Usage

This generator is used to create potentially complex passwords for registering an account on any website.

First the user will be asked how many characters they would like in their password. Then, the user will choose whether they want numbers, UPPERCASE LETTERS, lowercase letters, and/or special characters. The generator will then randomly shuffle the options the user selects and output it onto the screen.
